# 0x03 Shell Variables & Expansions

This project explores **environment variables, shell initialization files, and expansions in Linux**. By completing these tasks, learners gain practical experience in:

- Creating and managing **local and environment variables**.
- Configuring **shell initialization files** for custom settings.
- Using **expansions** to perform dynamic operations in the shell.
- Customizing the shell environment and enhancing scripts.

## Directory Structure

All scripts are located in this folder and follow the naming convention provided by the tasks:

- `0-alias` → Creates an alias for the `ls` command.  
- `1-hello_you` → Example task using variables and expansions (replace with actual script name/content).  
- `2-username` → Example task for retrieving user information (replace with actual script name/content).  
- … (continue listing other scripts as you add them).

> **Note:** All scripts are exactly **2 lines long** and start with `#!/bin/bash`.  

## How to Use

1. Navigate to this folder in your terminal:
```bash
cd 0x03-shell_variables_expansions
