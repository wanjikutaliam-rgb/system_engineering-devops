# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Project Overview
This project explores processes and signals in Linux. Learners will gain practical experience in retrieving process IDs (PIDs), understanding background and foreground processes, and handling signals to control process behavior. By completing these tasks, learners will understand how processes interact with the operating system and how to manage them through Bash scripts.

## Tasks

- **Objective:** Learn how to retrieve the Process ID (PID) of the current script.
- **Description:** Write a Bash script that outputs its own PID.
- **Example:**
```bash
$ ./0-what-is-my-pid
